# DATA STRUCTURES 
---

- Data -> raw fact
- Data structure -> arrangement of data with logical relationship between individual elements
- Data must be accessed as fast as possible

> Algorithm -> Flow chart -> Program

- Textbook - Data Structures using C/C++, Langsum Yedidyah 2nd edition


## Classification 

1. Built-in DS - Integer, float, character, pointer
- directly operated upon machine instruction
- all data types are primitive data structures

2. User Defined DS - Arrays, Lists, Files
- Grouping of homogenous or heterogenous data types
	1. Linear Data Structures- linked list, stack, queue
	2. Non-Linear Data Structures - tree, graph


## Representation

1. Logical - Mathematical - Abstract
2. Implementation - Code

One program can have multiple implementations


# Linked List
----

- #### [[A1-Simply_Linked_List | Simply Linked List]]
- #### [[A2-Circular_Linked_List | Circular Linked List]]
- #### [[A3-Doubly_Linked_List | Double Linked List]]
