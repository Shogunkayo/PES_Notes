# TOPOLOGIES
----
- Graphs are mainly used in telecommunication and computer networks
- Networking uses the notation `G(N,L)` where `N` is the set of nodes and `L` is the set of links
- Topology is the orded in which nodes and edges are arranged in a network

## 1. Ring Topology
- Also called cycle graph
- Each vertex has a degree of 2 and the vertices are connected such that the graph forms a circle

## 2. Star Topology
- Consists of a central vertex which has links to other vertices
- The central vertex has a degree `n-1` where `n` is the total number of nodes. Other vertices have a degree of 1

## 3. Mesh Topology
- A complete graph where each node is connected to all the other nodes
- Each node has a degree `n-1` where `n` is the total number of nodes

## 4. Hybrid Topology
- Combination of two or more topologies
