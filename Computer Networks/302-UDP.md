# Connectionless Transport
---
- UDP does just as little as a transport protocol can do. Aside from the multiplexing/demultiplexing function and some light error checking, it adds nothing to IP. The application is almost directly talking with IP
- UDP is said to be connectionless as there is no handshaking between sending and receiving transport layer entities before sending a segment
- DNS typically uses UDP

## Reasons to choose UDP over TCP

1. Finer application level control over what data is sent and when: 
- Under UDP, as soon as an application process passes data to UDP, UDP will package the data inside a UDP segment and immediately pass the segment to the network layer 
- TCP, on the other hand, has a congestion-control mechanism that throttles the transport-layer TCP sender when one or more links between the source and destination hosts become excessively congested 
- TCP will also continue to resend a segment until the receipt of the segment has been acknowledged by the destination, regardless of how long reliable delivery takes 
- Real time applications require a minimum sending rate and hence use UDP

2. No connection establishment: 
- UDP does not introduce any delay to establish a connection
- This is one of the prinicpal reason why DNS runs over UDP
- QUIC protocol (Quick UDP Internet Connection) which is used in Chrome browser, uses UDP as its underlying transport protocol and implements reliability in an application-layer protocol on top of UDP

3. No connection state: 
- TCP maintains connection state in the end systems which includes receive and send buffers, congestion control parameters, and sequence and acknowledgement number parameters
- UDP does not maintain connection state and does not track any of these parameters
- A server devoted to a particular application can typically support many more active clients when the application runs over UDP rather than TCP

4. Small packet header overhead:
- TCP segment hast 20 bytes of header overhead in every segment
- UDP has only 8 bytes of overhead

| Application            | Application Layer Protocol | Transport Protocol |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Email                  | SMTP                       | TCP                |
| Remote terminal access | Telnet                     | TCP                |
| Web                    | HTTP                       | TCP                |
| File transfer          | FTP                        | TCP                |
| Remote file server     | NFS                        | Typically UDP      |
| Streaming multimedia   | Typically proprietary      | UDP or TCP         |
| Internet telephony     | Typically proprietary      | UDP or TCP         |
| Network Management     | SNMP                       | Typically UDP      |
| Name translation       | DNS                        | Typically UDP                   |

- Though running multimedia applications over UDP is common, congestion control is needed to prevent the network from entering a congested state (if everyone starts to stream high bit rate video) in which very little useful work is done

## UDP Segment

- Application data occupies the data field of the UDP segment. For example, for DNS the data field contains either a query message or a response message
- The UDP header has four fields, each consisting of two bytes
- The length field specifies the number of bytes in the UDP segment
- The checksum is used by the receiving host to check whether errors have been introduced into the segment

### UDP Checksum
- UDP checksum provides for error detection. The checksum is used to determine whether bits within the UDP segment have been altered 
- UDP at the sender side performs the 1s complement of the sum of all the 16-bit words in the segment, with any overflow being wrapped around

Suppose there are 3 16-bit words
```
0110011001100000
0101010101010101
1000111100001100
```

The sum of the first two gives
```
1011101110110101
```

Adding the third word gives (overflow is wrapped around => added to the lsb)
```
0100101011000010
```

The 1s complement of this is the checksum
```
1011010100111101
```

At the receiver, all four 16-bit words are added, including the checksum. If no errors are introduced into the packet, the sum at the receiver will be 
```
1111111111111111
```

- Even though many link layer protocols (including Ethernet) also provide error checking, there is no gurantee that all links between source and destination provider provide error checking
- Even if segments are correctly transferred across a link, it's possible that bit errors could be introduced when a segment is stored in a router's memory
- UDP must provide error detection at the transport layer, on an end-end basis, if the end-end data transfer service is to provide error detection
- End-end principle: since certain functionality (error detection in this case) must be implemented on an end-end basis, "functions placed at the lower levels may be redundant or of little value when compared to the cost of providing them at the higher level
- Although UDP provides error checking, it does not do anything to recover from an error
