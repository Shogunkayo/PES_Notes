- Port numbers => 2^16
- Multiplexing at sender => handle data from multiple sockets, add transport header
- Demultiplexing at receiver
- Host receives IP datagrams
	- each datagram has source IP address, destination IP address
	- each datagram carries one transport layer segment
	- each segment has source, destination port number
- Host uses IP addresses and port numbers to direct segment to appropriate socket
- 2 tuples for UDP demultiplexing => destination IP address and destination port number
- 4 tuples for TCP demultiplexing => destination IP address, destination port number, source IP address and source port number
