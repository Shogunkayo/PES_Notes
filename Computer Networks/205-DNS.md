# Domain Name System
---
- Hostname is the identifier for a host. They are mnemonic and are human readable
- Becuase they consist of variable length alphanumeric characters, they would be difficult to process by routers.
- Hosts are also identified by IP addresses. An IP address consists of four bytes and has a rigid hierarchical structure
- People prefer the hostname identifier, routers prefer IP addresses. The main task of DNS is to translate hostnames to IP addresses
- DNS is
	1. a distributed database implemented in a hierarchy of DNS servers
	2. an application layer protocol that allows hosts to query the distributed database
- DNS servers are often UNIX machines running Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) software
- The DNS protocol runs over UDP and uses port 53
- The DNS is specified in RFC 1034 and RFC 1035

## DNS with HTTP
1. The user machine runs the client side of the DNS application
2. The browser extracts the hostname from the URL and passes the hostname to the client side of the DNS application
3. The DNS client sends a query containing the hostname to a DNS server
4. The DNS client eventually receives a reply, which includes the IP address for the hostname (`gethostbyname()` is the function call that an application calls in order to perform the translation)
5. Once the browser receives the IP address from DNS, it can initiate a TCP connection to the HTTP server process located at port 80 at that IP address

Though DNS adds an additional delay (sometimes substantial), the desired IP address is often cached in a nearby DNS server which helps to reduce DNS network traffic as well as the average DNS delay

## Other services
### Host aliasing
- A host with a complicated hostname can have o- Host aliasingne or more alias names
- The original name is said to be a canonical hostname
- Alias hostnames are typically more mnemonic than the canonical hostname
- DNS can be invoked by an application to obtain the canonical hostname for a supplied alias hostname as well as the IP address of the host
`www.enterprise.com` can be an alias hostname for `relay1.west-coast.enterprise.com`

### Mail server aliasing
- It is desirable that email addresses be mnemonic
`bob@yahoo.com` rather than `bob@relay1.west-coast.yahoo.com`
- DNS can be invoked by a mail application to obtain the canonical hostname for a supplied alias hostname as well as the IP address of the host
- A mail exchange (MX) record permits a company's mail server and web server to have identical alias hostnames

### Load distribution
- Busy sites are replicated over multiple servers, with each server running on a different end system and each having a different IP address
- A set of IP addresses is associated with one canonical hostname
- When a client makes a DNS query for a name mapped to a set of addresses, the server responds with the entire set of IP addresses, but rotates the ordering of the addresses within each reply
- Because a client typically sends its HTTP request message to the IP address that is listed first in the set, DNS rotation distributes the traffic among the replicated servers
- DNS rotation is also used for email so that multiple mail servers can have the same alias name

## Working of DNS
### Centralized design failures
- Single point of failure: if DNS server crashes, so does the entire internet
- Traffic volume: a single DNS server would have to handle all DNS queries
- Distant centralized database: a single DNS server cannot be close to all the querying clients => leads to significant delays
- Maintenance: a single DNS server would have to keep records for all internet hosts. This centralized database will be huge and have to be updated frequently to account for every new host

### Distributed Hierarchical Database
- DNS uses a large number of servers, organized in a hierarchical fashion and distributed around the world
- No single DNS server has all of the mappings for all of the hosts in the internet

The client first contacts one of the root servers, which returns IP addresses for TLD servers for the top level domain. The client then contacts one of these TLD servers, which returns the IP address of an authoritative server. Finally the client contacts one of the authoritative servers, which returns the IP address for the hostname

#### Root DNS Server
- Over 400 root name servers scattered all over the world, managed by 13 different organizations
- Provides the IP addresses of the TLD servers

#### Top-Level Domain (TLD) Server
- For each top level domain like `com`, `org`, `in`, `uk`, there is a TLD server
- Verisign Global Registry Services maintains the TLD servers for `com` and Educause maintains the TLD for `edu`
- Provides the IP addresses for authoritative DNS servers
- In general, the TLD server may know only of an intermediate DNS server, which in turn knows the authoritative DNS server for the hostname

#### Authoritative DNS Server
- Every organization with publicly accessible hosts on the internet must provide publicly accessible DNS records that map the names of those hosts to IP addresses
- The organization's authoritative DNS server houses these DNS records
- An organization can choose to implement its own authoritative DNS server or pay a service provider

#### Local DNS Server
- Each ISP has a local DNS server
- When a host connects to an ISP, the ISP provides the host with the IP addresses of one or more of its local DNS servers

DNS queries can be either recursive or iterative

### DNS Caching
- When a DNS server receives a DNS reply, it can cache the mapping in its local memory
- If a hostname/ip address pair is cached in a DNS server and another query arrives to the DNS server for the same hostname, the DNS server can provide the desired IP address
- DNS servers discard cached information after a period of time as the mappings are not permanent
- Root servers are bypasses for all but a very small fraction of DNS queries
