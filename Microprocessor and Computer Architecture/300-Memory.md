# Memory
---
CPU basic components:
- RAM (latches and decoder)
- Register
	- Instruction Register
	- Program Counter
	- Accumulator
- Buses
	- Address
	- Data
	- Control

- Memory latency is the time it takes to transfer a word of data to or from memory
- Memory bandwidth is the number of bits or bytes that can be transferred in one second

## Speed vs Size vs Cost
Fast memory is more expensive per bit than slower
90/10 rule => a program spends 90% of its time in 10% of its code

## CPU Cache
- Cache memory is an architectural arrangement which makes the main memory appear faster to the processor than it really is
- Level 3 > 2 > 1 in size, 1 > 2 > 3 in speed
