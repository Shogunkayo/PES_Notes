# ARM Processor (Acron RISC Machine)
-----
- Based on RISC principles (load-store architecture, fixed length 32bit instructions, 3 address instruction formats), but suffer less from poor code density than most other RISCs
- Where code density is of prime importance, ARM Limited has incorporated Thumb architecture into some versions of the ARM processor
- The Thumb instruction set is a 16-bit compressed form of the original 32-bit ARM instruction set and employs dynamic decompression hardware in the instruction pipeline
- Thumb code density is better than that achieved by most CISC processors

## RISC Features rejected by ARM
### Register windows
- RISC processors incorporated a large number of registers.
- Procedure entry and exit instructions moved the visible 'window' to give each procedure access to new register
- Large chip area was occupiied by large number of registers

### Delayed branches
- Branches cause pipeline problems since they interrupt the smooth flow of instructions
- Delayed branches => branch takes effect after the following instruction has executed
- Do not scale well to super-scalar implementations and can interact badly with branch prediction mechanisms

### Single-cycle execution of all instructions
- ARM executes most data processing instructions in a single clock cycle, many other instructions take multiple clock cycles.
- A simple load or store instruction requires at least two memory accesses.
- Single cycle operation of all instructions is only possible with separate data and instruction memories.

## Organiztaion of ARM (3 stage PP)
1. Register bank which stores the processor state
2. Barrel shifter which can shift or rotate one operand by any number of bits
3. ALU which performs arithmetic and logic functions 
4. Address register and incrementor, which select and hold all memory addresses and generate sequential addresses when required
5. Data registers which hold data passing to and from memory
6. Instruction decoder and associated control logic

## ARM Programmer's Model
- A processor's instruction set defineds the operations that the programmer can use to change the state of system incorporating the processor
- Each instruction can be viewed as performing a defined transformation from the state before the instruction is executed to the state after it has completed
- When writing user-level programs, only the 15 general purpose 32-bit registers (r0 to t14), the program counter (r15) and the current program status register (CPSR) need to be considered
- The remaining registers are used only for system level programming and for handling exceptions

### CPSR
![[cpsr.png]]![cpsr](https://github.com/Shogunkayo/PES_Notes/blob/main/Microprocessor%20and%20Computer%20Architecture/Images/cpsr.png)
- Used in user-level programs to store the condition code bits
- The bits at the bottom of the register control the processor mode, instruction set(T) and interrupt enables(I and F) and are protected from change by the user-level program
- The top four bits;
	- N => Negative
	- Z => Zero
	- C => Carry out as a result of an arithmetic operation in the ALU or from the shifter
	- V => Overflow into the sign bit

### Memory State
- In addition to the processor register state, an ARM system has memory state
- Memory may be viewed as a linear array of bytes numbered from zero to 2^32 - 1
- Data items may be 8bit bytes, 16bit half words or 32bit words
- Words are always aligned on 4-byte boundaries and half words are aligned on 2-byte boundaries. All the data items can be either signed or unsigned

![[byteaddr.png]]![byteaddr](https://github.com/Shogunkayo/PES_Notes/blob/main/Microprocessor%20and%20Computer%20Architecture/Images/byteaddr.png)

### Load-store architecture
- The instruction set will only process values which are in registers and will always place the results of such processing into a register
- The only operations which apply to memory state are ones which copy memory values into registers (load instructions) or copy register values into memory (store instructions)
- All ARM instructions fall into one of the three categories

#### Data processing instructions
- Use and change only register values

#### Data transfer instructions
- Copy memory values into registers or copy register values into memory
- Exchange a memory value with a register value - useful in system code
even
#### Control flow instructions
- Cause execution to switch to a different address, either permanently(branch) or saving a return address to resume the original sequence (branch and link) or trapping into system code (supervisor calls)

### Supervisor mode
- ARM processor supports a protected supervisor mode where user code cannot gain supervisor privileges without appropriate checks to prevent illegal operations
- Systen-level functions can only be accessed through specified supervisor calls
- These functions generally include any accesses to hardware peripheral registers

### ARM instruction set
- All ARM instructions are 32-bits wide and are aligned on 4-byte boundaries in memory
- Load-store architecture
- 3-address data processing instructions => 2 source operand registers and the result registers are all independently specified
- Conditional execution of every instruction

### I/O system
- ARM handles I/O peripherals as memory mapped devices with interrupt support
- Peripherals may attract the processor's attention by making an interrupt request using either the normal interrupt(IRQ) or the fast interrupt (FIQ), both of which are level-sensitive and maskable

### ARM exceptions
- ARM architecture supports a range of interrupts, traps and supervisor calls, all grouped under the general heading of exceptions
- The general way these are handled is the same in all cases:
1. The current state is saved by copying the PC into `r14_exc` and CPSR into `SPSR_exc` where `exc` stands for exception type
2. The processor operating mode is changed to the appropriate exception mode
3. The PC is forced to a value between `00` and `1C` (base 16), the particular value depending on the type of exception

LDR R0, =a    ; Load the address of a to R0
LDR R1, =b    ; Load the address of b to R1
LDR R3, =c    ; Load the address of c to R3
LDR R4, [r1]  ; Load the value (100) to R4

ADD R6, R4, R5; Add R4 and R5
STR R6, [r3]  ; Store the result (300) in the address specified in R3

.data
a: .word 100  ; variable a of data type word

### General Format of Instruction
`MNEMONIC {condition}{S} {Rd}, Operand1, Operand2`
- `MNEMONIC` - short name of the instructions
- `{condition}` - condition that is needed to be met in order for the instruction to be executed
| Condition | Description                  |
| --------- | ---------------------------- |
| eq        | equal                        |
| ne        | not equal                    |
| cc or lo  | carry clear                  |
| cs or hs  | carry set                    |
| mi        | negative (negative)          |
| pl        | positive (plus)              |
| vs        | signed overflow              |
| vc        | no signed overflow           |
| hi        | unsigned higher              |
| ls        | unsigned lower or same       |
| ge        | signed greater than or equal |
| lt        | signed lesser than           |
| gt        | signed greater than          |
| le        | signed lesser than or equal  |
| al        | always executed (default)                             |

- `{S}` - an optional suffix to update the condition flags on the result of the operation ie to set `N`,`O`,`C`,`V` of the cpsr
- `{Rd}` - destination register for storing the result of the instruction
- `Operand1` - first operand, either a register or an immediate value
- `Operand2` - second operand, can be an immediate value or a register with an optional shift

```
.text
MOV r0, #-44
MOV r1, #4
SUBS r2, r0, r1
ADDMIS r0, r0, r1 ; adds only if the result of sub is negative
.end
```

```
.text
MOV r0, #44
MOV r1, #4
CMP r1, r0       ;compare r1 and r0
ADDEQ r0, r0, r1 ;add only if the comparison is true
```
- If comparison is true, `N` is set to 0 and if false, `N` is set to 1
